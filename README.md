## Why FLUX?

Current email protocols were designed decades ago for a different internet. FLUX solves their fundamental problems with a modern approach:

-   ‚ö° **Lightning Speed**: A binary protocol and native compression reduce latency and bandwidth usage by up to 75%. Sync a 10,000-email inbox in 2.3 seconds, not 45.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Unyielding Security**: End-to-end encryption (E2EE) isn't an option; it's mandatory. FLUX ensures that only the sender and recipient can ever read message contents.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Absolute Simplicity**: With a "0-Config" setup and intuitive SDKs, developers can integrate FLUX in hours, not weeks, accelerating time-to-market.

## Core Features

-   ‚úÖ **Real-Time Synchronization**: Changes are instantly pushed to all connected devices over a persistent, bidirectional link.
-   ‚úÖ **Binary Efficiency**: Unlike text-based protocols, FLUX uses a compact binary format for superior throughput and lower overhead.
-   ‚úÖ **Native Offline Support**: Clients maintain a consistent state and transparently sync the moment a connection is restored.
-   ‚úÖ **Efficient Push Notifications**: Built into the protocol, eliminating the need for inefficient workarounds like IMAP IDLE.
-   ‚úÖ **Modern SDKs**: Clean, idiomatic libraries for JavaScript, Python, Go, and other key enterprise languages.
-   ‚úÖ **Seamless Multi-Device Experience**: Designed from day one for flawless state synchronization across desktop, web, and mobile platforms.

## SDK Quick Start

Integrating the FLUX SDK is incredibly straightforward. Below are some common usage examples.

### JavaScript (Node.js)

```javascript
// Connect to a FLUX server with end-to-end encryption
import { FluxClient } from '@fluxprotocol/sdk';

const client = new FluxClient({
  host: 'flux.example.com',
  port: 443,
  user: 'you@example.com',
  token: 'your_auth_token',
});

await client.connect();
// Real-time synchronization begins automatically
